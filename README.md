Prototype of an one-key finesse game, but using mouse instead of keyboard.

## How to Play

Each cell of the bottom four rows are mapped to a piece position and rotation state. The column of the cell indicates the position of the piece, and the row indicates the rotation of the piece.

For example, if you click the second column from left to right, third row from bottom to top, the piece will be placed at that column, rotated clockwise from its original state.

The first, second, third and fourth rows from bottom to top are mapped to counter-clockwise, normal, clockwise and 180 rotations, respectively.
